# leaflet_challenge

- The aim of this challange is to create the Earthquake Visualization.

- created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

- Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

- Created a legend that will provide context for the map data.
